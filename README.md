# arch-setup
This is a simple script to make it easier to setup Arch Linux

Releases from this branch might be unstable. Use at your own risk.
I personally test these scripts in an almost-"clean" Arch Linux virtualmachine. The only programs 
installed before starting these scripts are elinks and the virtualbox guest addations.

Feel free to edit the scripts to your liking.
